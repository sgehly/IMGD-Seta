Overall, this week we were happy where the board was and decided to spend our time on refining mechanics. That being said, we made a few minor edits. We made four different card stacks, one for the movement cards, one for the special cards, and discard piles for both. In addition, we changed the sizes of the decorative icons as to not confuse players, added single bullet piles to the middle of the board so it wasn't a ghost town, and made overall refinements to the positions of some of the spaces as to make sure it was A E S T H E T I C.
