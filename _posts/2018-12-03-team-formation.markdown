Ah another wonderful Monday here at WPI. Hyped up on finally being done with assignment 4 for IMDG1000, the hype is immediately crushed when Dean and Sam announce assignment 5. The big and bad two-week final project. As usual, the class had to break up into teams, but being award tech kids, everyone pretty much stuck with their groups from before. And that’s the story of Assignment 5 Group 3 consisting of Hannah Goodsell, Hunter Trautz, John Frazia, and Samuel Gehly and myself. To no surprise, we had no idea what our game was going to be, so in a combined effort of sarcastic commentary John and I ended up picking a normal deck of cards, six colored soldiers and a bag of 100 zombies for our three “things” to make a game with. The plan is to make a team-based survival game. We’ll see how that goes. 
Team if you’re reading this, I propose a toast. A toast to maybe getting a good grade this time around!
