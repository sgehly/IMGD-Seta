The game wasn't always the free-for-all capture the flag type game. When we first got our materials we had the bag of zombies miniatures, a deck of cards, and 6 armed miniatures. At first, we thought of the idea of a co-op zombie survival game with player classes. The idea was to get to the other side of the map and to collect certain parts on the way to escape. However, we ran into a numerous amount of walls with the materials that we had picked and thus decided as a group to discard the project and take the bullet chits to make the free-for-all game that is around today.
