What seemed like would be a day of panic ended up going quite smooth. We had previously tasked Sam with digitally creating the board prototype and with the power of photoshop, we were able to adjust the board as we play tested. We found that our initial prototype had too many movement spaces, especially in the inner most rings. So, we reduced the amount to make games go by quicker. Also, we found that once players were in the middle of the circle, they would run out of bullets quickly and attacking seemed impossible because there were no bullet crates in the center, so we added a new bullet power up in the inner circle that awards players 1 bullet as opposed to the 2 bullets that the crates give. Once we felt like our first iteration was complete, we collectively edited the rules on the google doc and expanded our lore to include the systems of play. Hopefully this game is as smooth as we think it is.
