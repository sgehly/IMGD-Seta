Hey remember that panic I thought we had avoided…well it came just in time for the first iteration due date. So, when you make a board heavily reliant on being able to print it out, you should probably make sure there is a decent printer for you to use. My printer is like 15 years old. After making some last-minute changes to rule clarity, I needed to print out the rules and the board. I thought to myself, 40 minutes is plenty of time to print out a few sheets. Then I get hit with the There was an error in printing please try again. So, I try again. There was an error in printing please try again. Oh boy let’s reboot, that should work. 10 minutes later, There was an error in printing please try again. “SHIT!” With 25 minutes left I frantically reinstalled my printer drivers. 10 minutes before class I thought I’d finally able to print and then I see, “Printer alignment in progress please wait”. I almost threw the printer out the damn window, but refrained from doing so because res-services would charge me two times my tuition in damages if I did that. Luckily, about 2 minutes before class was about to start, it finally started to print. I sprinted my ass to fuller labs and made it to class only a few minutes late. All was well, but I almost had a heart attack today.
