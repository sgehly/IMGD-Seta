When designing a product, it's important to keep the consumer in mind. With SETE, we are marketing as a family game for families with teens or pre-teens. If parents let their kids play Call of Duty then the whole "war" thing should be fine. That being said, we designed our board to be bright and colorful in order to downplay the violence aspect of the game (You truly can't die in the game, just get bounced back a bit). The circular board proved to be a bit of a challenge when evenly spacing the spots, however with the time constraints this design works fairly well.
