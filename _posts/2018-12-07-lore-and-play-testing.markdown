Based on how we placed the soldier figurines and how we moving towards the center where the red soldier is located, it seemed like the perfect scenario for the game to take place in would be a rescue operation. Since the soldier figurines are different colors and we had the base idea of the lore, it made sense for the colors to represent other countries. With that finished, we started playing the game to see what problems we ran into. 

The main one we found was how players would get bullets. Originally we only had crates spread across the board at some points that gave the player two bullets when crossed over. That lead to the question of what happens when you change directions and cross over the same crate, so we changed it so the player had to land on the crate in order to gain bullets and if you already landed on that crate once, you don't pick up bullets again.
