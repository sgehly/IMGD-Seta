Today we embarked on the first of hopefully many team meetings to grind out a decent game. After having switched out our bag of 100 zombies for a bag of 223 bullet chips and deciding on a competitive/PvP game over a cooperative survival, the real work began. First off, we needed a board to play with. We decided that since this is to be a competitive game, the board needed to be balanced and using a square or rectangle would prove difficult for a game with separate starting points and various power ups throughout the game. “What’s more balanced than a circle”, John asked? “No ide,a lets go with that” Sam responded. Hence, the circular game board was born and Hannah being the only one with any artistic abilities began to draw out our first prototype. John also tried to help but failed at making the initial circle, so we cut him out of the art team. The circular board sparked the idea for a capture the flag type game where players have to get the object in the center and bring it back to their home base. Being that one of our “things” to use are six various colored soldiers and this needs to be a 5-player game, we decided to make it a rescue the wounded soldier game with the red soldier being placed in the middle for the other soldiers (the players) to try and rescue. By the end of this meeting, we had a card based movement system, an attack system with bullets and bullet crate power ups spread out on a decent board. A good start I'd say.
