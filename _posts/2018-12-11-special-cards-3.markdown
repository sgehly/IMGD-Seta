Due to player feedback that the acquisition of special cards felt too random we changed the cards again. We made it so that you could buy specific cards with your bullets, removed the jacks, and gave the special cards their own price and switched the abilities for the queen and the jack. Now the jack was worth 3 bullets, the queen was worth 4, the king was worth 5, and the ace was worth 6.
