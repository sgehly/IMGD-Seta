Lore remained largely the same, though we did add some details. 2028 sounds like a good year for World War III and Sandport is now a battlefield instead of a desert, because why not add more war lingo? Sgt Fugifino now has some useful intel to share with the countries trying to capture him, what a guy. We also had to futurize the lore to support the special cards. Hell just ask the aliens in the top right I mean that would've also been a good explanation.
