In the first iteration of the game, the playerâ€™s movement was a static number. However, we quickly realized that this made the game lack meaningful choice and we decided to replace this with movement cards. All the movement cards were equally distributed amongst players at the beginning of the game, and when players ran out of cards the discard pile was shuffled and redistributed. After playtesting, we felt that this was better than randomly drawing a card each turn from the top of the pickup pile to move. By having a hand of movement cards to choose from, players could now strategically save their higher movement cards for when they were escorting the red solider, or use them early on to get a head start on other players.
