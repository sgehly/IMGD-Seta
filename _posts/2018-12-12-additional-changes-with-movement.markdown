We decided that distributing all of the movement cards at the beginning of the game was too overwhelming for the players. In addition, as the game went on and more movement cards were used, players had fewer choices until the deck was redistributed. To improve upon this we decided to only give players 5 cards each at the start, and then draw a card from the pickup pile each time they use a movement card. This made it so players always had a consistent amount of movement cards and therefore decisions.
