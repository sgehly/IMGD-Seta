Today we spent class reading the analyses on our game that were given to us by another group in our class. The majority of them were pretty good and we got some great advice to make the game better. But some were really, how do I say it... absurd? For example, someone said we should make a team-based game where shooting teammates advances their position on the board. Since when do bullets help people who get shot by them? Even Call of Duty isn’t that unrealistic. Anyways, we did decide to change up how our movement cards were distributed and change the economy to make special cards more accessible based off these analyses. It seemed like some people were also a bit confused with the rules, with certain aspects of movement and attacking not being clear. I’m kind of in charge of the whole rule’s thing so my bad. I’ll fix it.
