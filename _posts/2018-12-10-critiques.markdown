After another team play tested our first iteration of the game, we looked at the critiques. Some of the suggestions did not make sense in relation to what our lore is and how bullets work in real life. One suggestion they mentioned was to make the game a cooperative game that involves shooting your teammate forward into a spot that is closer to the red soldier, with your bullets.Based on what the lore is and the fact that bullets harm people in real life, we decided to not follow with this.
 
While they were playing the game, they came up to us a few times to ask about the rules, so we knew that we needed to calrify the rules as a whole. Fixing the rules was the main issue that we focused on since the mechanics worked and made sense to the players.
