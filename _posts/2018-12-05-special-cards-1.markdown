The original special cards were the jack, queen, and king face cards plus the ace. The jack allowed you to shoot from anywhere on the board, the queen gave you a bullet shield for one bullet, the king allowed you to double your movement for one movement, and the ace allowed you to switch places with another player. The way to get them however, was just through random draws on certain spaces.
